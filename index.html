            <p>A wise YouTuber once said: "The Legend of Zelda is an Action Adventure game series about exploring
                dungeons and being murdered by chickens". The series was created by Nintendo on the Nintendo
                Entertainment System, and has since been one of Nintendo's flagship franchises, along with Mario.</p>
